# Single-cell Transcriptomic Profiling of Epilepsy Patients for Biomarker Discovery
## Background
Epilepsy is a complex neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures, affecting millions of individuals worldwide. Despite advances in treatment, a significant proportion of patients remain refractory to current therapies, highlighting the urgent need for novel biomarkers to aid in diagnosis and guide therapeutic strategies. This study employs single-cell transcriptomic profiling to analyze the gene expression patterns of individual cells from surgically resected epileptic lesion tissues. By leveraging high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we aim to identify cell type-specific transcriptional changes and uncover potential molecular biomarkers associated with epilepsy. Our findings could reveal distinct gene expression signatures in various cell populations, including neurons, glial cells, and immune cells, that are linked to epileptogenesis. Furthermore, we expect to identify new candidate biomarkers that may serve as predictive indicators of disease severity and treatment response. The results of this study could provide new insights into the cellular and molecular underpinnings of epilepsy, offering promising avenues for biomarker discovery and the development of targeted therapies.
